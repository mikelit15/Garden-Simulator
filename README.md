# README

This program takes in a list of plants from online, filters through them, and allows the user to 
design a garden based on given specifications to maximize the support of 'leps' (Butterflies, moths, etc.)

The program starts on a welcome screen with pictures of plants on it. It progresses to an input screen
where the user uses dropdowns and text input to specify the details of their garden. Then the user
draws goes to a different screen to draw the shape of the garden. After drawing the shape, they go to
a populating screen where they add plants to the garden using a drag and drop system. After that, they
are taken to a screen displaying information about leps. From there, they can restart or exit the program
